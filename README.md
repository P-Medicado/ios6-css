# iOS 6 components for CSS 
Reimplementation of the skeuomorphic design language pioneered by Apple &amp; Scott  

Components:  
- Analog Dial (Clock)  
- Analog Counter (Clock)  
- Delete Prompt (Shredder)  
- Heading (Metalic Reflective)  
- Subheading (Glossy Reflective)  
- Settings List  
- Background Gradients (Settings Wallpaper)  
- Popup Options (Schedule, Siri Prompt)  
  
## How to:  
These are written with vanilla css and html in mind. Copy and paste / drop-in usability. Each file holds in itself all the text required to recreate them. A component would have the content in `<html><body> <!-- Component HTML --> </body></html>`. The CSS styling for the component may be partly inline and partly in `<style>` tags: `<html><head><style> /* Component CSS */ </style></head></body>`.  
  
## Examples:  
You can find the collection hosted at [a website I have push access to PrettySights](https://prettysights.com/vsads/css-lounge/)
  
## Usage:  
I made these bc I love iOS 6 v v much. I have an iPod 4 y it makes me smile to see all the parallels to real-world design. These components can be modified and used in any way.  
  
## Plans:  
- Review the work of Alejandro Bur√≥n, Eli Schiff, Cole Rise, and Scott Forstall  
- Add documentation  
- Build our components in Vue & React  
- Simplify CSS
